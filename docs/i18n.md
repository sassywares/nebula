# i18n

## Server Side

Now, go to `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`, you will notice this:

```tsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  return config.i18n.locales.map((locale) => ({ locale }));
}
```

What this does, [as per the docs](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing#add-generatestaticparams), is that it generates the static params for the `[locale]` route segment. This is required if you want to use the app as a static site.

Then, scroll down and you will see this:

```tsx
export async function generateMetadata(props: LayoutProps): Promise<Metadata> {
  const { locale } = await props.params;

  const t = await getTranslations({ locale, namespace: "metadata" });

  return {
    title: t("title"),
    description: t("description"),
  };
}
```

Ignore everything, and focus on the `getTranslations` call. If you want translations on the server side, this is what you need to call.

- `locale` is the current locale.
- `namespace` is the namespace you want to get the translations from.

You can learn more about namespaces [here](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/usage/messages#rendering-messages-with-usetranslations).

Then, scroll down and find this:

```tsx
export default async function LocaleLayout({ params, children }: LayoutProps) {
  const { locale } = await params;

  const direction = getLangDir(locale);

  // Ensure that the incoming `locale` is valid
  if (!routing.locales.includes(locale as any)) {
    notFound();
  }

  // Enable static rendering
  setRequestLocale(locale);

  // Providing all messages to the client side is the easiest way to get started
  const messages = await getMessages();

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body {...}>
        <NextIntlClientProvider messages={messages}>
          ...
        </NextIntlClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

There's a lot happening here, let's break it down.

1. We get the locale from the params.
2. We get the direction of the locale using the `getLangDir` helper from the `rtl-detect` package.
3. We ensure that the incoming `locale` is valid. If it's not, we call `notFound()`. Since this layout wraps the entire app, this validation goes all the way down to every single page in the app.
4. We set the locale using `setRequestLocale`. This is necessary for next-intl to know which locale to use when rendering statically.
5. We get the messages for the current locale.

Then, we wrap the entire app in the `NextIntlClientProvider`. This is necessary for the app to be able to switch locales on the client side.

## Client Side

On the client, you can simply call the `useTranslations` hook, for example:

```tsx
const t = useTranslations("common");
```

This is used in the `src/app/[locale]/rq/users/[id]/page.tsx` file.

If you, for whatever reason, need the locale on the client side, you can either use the `useLocale` from `next-intl` or the `useParams` from Next.js.

That's all there is to it! You have an app that supports i18n out of the box.
